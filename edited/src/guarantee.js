    description:
      "This is perhaps the most important Principle and the essence of what it means to be a lawyer. As a fiduciary, a lawyer must always act in the best interest of his or her client, consistent with the wishes and desires of the client. A lawyer must act with fidelity and undivided loyal with respect to his client. And a lawyer cannot profit from his position beyond what is agreed to by the client in terms of a reasonable fee and just compensation.",

    description:
      "We all have a basic understanding of what integrity and honesty mean (to act consistent with a certain set of values); however, for a lawyer, it also means speaking favorably and positively about his client even when his client is not present. It also means being honest and truthful with a client and being realistic about expectations and outcomes. In all instances, integrity for a lawyer means never compromising the interests of his client. Clients are comforted in knowing their lawyer has their back and is always serving the client's interest",

    description:
      "It's ironic that our legal system is grounded in the tenets of fundamental fairness, justice and equality, yet many people and lawyers approach the legal process as though they were entering into some type of battle intent on “defeating” the enemy. Being an advocate for your client does not mean you must take advantage of a situation to the detriment of another person or beat your adversary into submission. That is not what the legal process is about and is not what i believe as a lawyer. When you consider that better than 95% of all lawsuits settle before trial, you begin to appreciate the wisdom in approaching your conflict with an open mind for creative solutions from the outset.
